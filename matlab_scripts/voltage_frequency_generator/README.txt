This folder contains a MATLAB script to generate input voltage players
for a system.  The idea being that these would be played into the SWING/slack
bus on the system to manipulate the voltage levels and underlying frequency of
the system.

**** Included files ****
data_volt_freq_player_A.csv - the phase A voltage player using the default settings
							  of Gen_Phasor_Freq_Mag_Voltages.m
							  
data_volt_freq_player_B.csv - the phase B voltage player using the default settings
							  of Gen_Phasor_Freq_Mag_Voltages.m
							  
data_volt_freq_player_C.csv - the phase C voltage player using the default settings
							  of Gen_Phasor_Freq_Mag_Voltages.m
							  
Gen_Phasor_Freq_Mag_Voltages.m - the MATLAB script to generate the files

Sample_Output.png - The voltage magnitude, angle, and frequency generated by the default
					settings in the Gen_Phasor_Freq_Mag_Voltages.m file.

test_Frequency.glm - An example GridLAB-D file with the generated player input
				     and a recorder to verify the response.
					 
README.txt - This file

**** Example ****
Once the script has been run and generated the voltage files
(data_volt_freq_player_X.csv), they would typically be input into a
SWING/slack node as follows:

	object node {
		phases ABCN;
		name source_node;
		nominal_voltage 7200.0;
		bustype SWING;
		object player {
			flags DELTAMODE; 	//Assuming frequency changes are deltamode
			property voltage_A;	//Phase A
			file data_volt_freq_player_A.csv;
		}
		object player {
			flags DELTAMODE;
			property voltage_B;	//Phase B
			file data_volt_freq_player_B.csv;
		}
		object player {
			flags DELTAMODE;
			property voltage_C;	//Phase C
			file data_volt_freq_player_C.csv;
		}

This is the same approach as the example in the test_Frequency.glm on lines 72:98.
