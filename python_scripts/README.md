Tool Scripts for GridLAB-D in Python

## GlmParser

1) The class 'GlmParser' parses the .glm file, ignoring all comments;
2) UFLS GFA devices can be added to 'load' and 'triplex_load' objects, using the class 'GlmParser'.

## Simple_GLD_Run_Example

Provides an extremely simplified example of a Python 3.x script (in Windows) to run GridLAB-D and copy results.
The script is extremely basic and basically meaningless, but shows the mechanics needed.
